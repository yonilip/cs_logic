Technical Details:


Folder Hierarchy:

The provided zip file (attached below) contains a folder named "code" with the following files in the following structure:

~/propositions/syntax.py    #a skeleton for your code

~/propositions/syntax_test.py    #test functions

~/test_ex1.py    #a script that runs the tests



General Comments:

* Please check your code with the provided tests (by running functions from test_ex1.py script). We would run the same tests while grading your exercise, in addition to a manual inspection of the code.

* Please ignore the tests that are not called by test_ex1.py (those that end with _all_operators), as they're for later exercises.

* You are more than welcome to add your own tests if you feel that the provided tests are insufficient. You can submit your test file but it won't be graded. 



Submission format:

Please submit a zip file with the following format:

ex1_[student_id 9-digits].zip 

(for example: if Freddie's id is 200443322, then Freddie should submit a zip file named ex1_200443322.zip)

Your zip file should include your "code/" directory with its full structure as provided to you. More specifically, in this exercise you must include only the file: 

code/propositions/syntax.py

You can submit the rest of the files, and we will ignore them while grading your exercise.



We wish you a pleasant logic programming!
