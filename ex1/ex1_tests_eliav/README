1. put eliav_tests.py, tests_generator_ex1 and tests in 'code' folder

2. open cmd and move and move to 'code' folder

3. run 'python3 eliav_tests.py'

*Recommendation*
Run the script as follow: "python3 eliav_tests.py > 'summary.txt'" it will save the test outputs in summary.txt.
Thus solving bugs can be much more easy :).

Good luck! :)
